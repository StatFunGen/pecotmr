\title{Format Multigroup cTWAS Input Lists
Aggregates gene data from the 'summary_report' table and organizes it into nested lists. These lists are hierarchically structured by `gwas_study_name`, chromosome (chr`chr_number`), and then grouped under "weights_list" with each gene identified by `gene_name` and its `context` (`gene_name`|`context`).}
\usage{
get_ctwas_input(
  summary_report,
  outdir = NULL,
  outname = NULL,
  weights_input_file = NULL,
  auto_save = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{summary_report}{A data frame containing metadata about each gene, including imputable contexts and the best-performing TWAS methods.}

\item{outdir}{The directory where the output will be saved. If not specified, the current working directory is used.}

\item{weights_input_file}{Path to an existing weight list file. This file is used to append additional weights based on new entries in the `summary_report`.}

\item{auto_save}{Boolean flag indicating whether to automatically save the output to the `outdir` or use the current working directory if `outdir` is not specified. Default is `FALSE`.}
