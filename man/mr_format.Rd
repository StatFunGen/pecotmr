\title{MR Format Function}
\usage{
mr_format(
  susie_result,
  condition,
  gwas_sumstats_db,
  sets = "sets",
  coverage = "coverage_0.95",
  allele_qc = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{susie_result}{A list containing the results of SuSiE analysis. This list should include nested elements such as 'susie_results', 'susie_result_trimmed', and 'top_loci', containing details about the statistical analysis of genetic variants.}

\item{condition}{A character string specifying the conditions. This is used to select the corresponding subset of results within 'susie_result'.}

\item{gwas_sumstats_db}{A data frame containing summary statistics from GWAS studies. It should include columns for variant id and their associated statistics such as beta coefficients and standard errors.}

\item{sets}{A character string indicating the method used to define sets of genetic variants. Defaults to "sets". This parameter is used to specify the type of sets to extract from the 'susie_result' object.}

\item{coverage}{A character string specifying the coverage threshold for credible sets, used when 'sets' is not "sets". Defaults to "coverage_0.95", indicating a 95% coverage credible set.}

\item{allele_qc}{Optional. A logical value indicating whether allele qc should be performed on the variants. When TRUE, allele qc are applied to the variants based on the GWAS summary statistics database ('gwas_sumstats_db').}
}
\value{
A data frame formatted for MR analysis or NULL if cs_list is empty.
