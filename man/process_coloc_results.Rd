\title{Main processing function
This function is designed to summarize coloc results based on the following criteria:
1. Among the colocalized variant pairs, PPH4 has the highest value compared to PPH0-PPH3.
2. PPH4 exceeds threshold, default as 0.8.
3. We aggregate variants and cumulatively sum their PPH4 values to form a credible set until the threshold, default as 0.95.
4. The cs's purity is computed with the `get_purity` function from the `gaow/susieR` package, and the same purity criteria are employed to filter the credibility set.}
