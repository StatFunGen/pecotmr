\title{Run multiple TWAS weight methods}
\usage{
twas_weights(X, Y, weight_methods, num_threads = 1, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of samples by features, where each row represents a sample and each column a feature.}

\item{Y}{A matrix (or vector, which will be converted to a matrix) of samples by outcomes, where each row corresponds to a sample.}

\item{weight_methods}{A list of methods and their specific arguments, formatted as list(method1 = method1_args, method2 = method2_args). 
methods in the list are applied to the datasets X and Y.}

\item{num_threads}{The number of threads to use for parallel processing.
If set to -1, the function uses all available cores.
If set to 0 or 1, no parallel processing is performed.
If set to 2 or more, parallel processing is enabled with that many threads.}
}
\value{
A list where each element is named after a method and contains the weight matrix produced by that method.
}
\description{
Applies specified weight methods to the datasets X and Y, returning weight matrices for each method.
Handles both univariate and multivariate methods, and filters out columns in X with zero standard error.
This function utilizes parallel processing to handle multiple methods.
}
