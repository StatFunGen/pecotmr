\title{Calculate Purity Measures for Credible Sets

As an extension of the internal cal_purity function. This function computes purity metrics (minimum, mean, and median absolute correlations)
for each credible set in a list of credible set indices, based on the provided X matrix.
The output Purity depends on the method specified: for the 'min' method,
it returns a single value for single-element sets or the minimum absolute correlation for others.
For other methods, it returns a vector of three values (min, mean, median) for each set.}
\usage{
cal_purity(l_cs, X, method = "min")
}
\arguments{
\item{l_cs}{A list of credible set indices, where each element is a vector of indices
corresponding to variables in a credible set.}

\item{X}{The data matrix used to compute correlations between variables in each credible set.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method to use for calculating purity.
Defaults to 'min'. Other methods return a vector of min, mean, and median
absolute correlations for each credible set.}
}
\value{
A list where each element corresponds to a credible set and contains either a single
        purity value (for 'min' method and single-element sets) or a vector of purity metrics
        (for other methods and multi-element sets).
