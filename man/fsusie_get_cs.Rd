\title{@title Create Sets Similar to SuSiE Output from fSuSiE Object}
\usage{
fsusie_get_cs(fSuSiE.obj, X, requested_coverage = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{fSuSiE.obj}{A fSuSiE object containing the results from a fSuSiE analysis.
expected to at least have 'cs' and 'alpha' components.}

\item{requested_coverage}{A numeric value specifying the desired coverage level for the
credible sets. This is purely for record purpose so should be
manually ensured that it correctly reflect the actual coverage used. Defaults to 0.95.}
}
\value{
A list containing named credible sets (cs), a dataframe of purity metrics
        (min.abs.corr, mean.abs.corr, median.abs.corr), an index of credible sets (cs_index),
        coverage values for each set, and the requested coverage level. Similar to the SuSiE set output
}
\description{
This function constructs a list that mimics the structure of SuSiE output sets
from a fSuSiE object. It includes credible sets (cs) with their names, a purity
dataframe, coverage information, and the requested coverage level.
