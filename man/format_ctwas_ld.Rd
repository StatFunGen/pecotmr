\title{Convert Lower Triangle LD Matrix to Symmetrical Full Matrix fot cTWAS analysis.}
\usage{
format_ctwas_ld(ld_paths, outdir)
}
\arguments{
\item{ld_paths}{A vector of full pathnames to LD matrix files, expected to follow the naming convention `/LD_path/chrN/chrN_start_end.cor.xz` with a corresponding bim file in the same directory, e.g., `/LD_path/chrN/chrN_start_end.cor.xz.bim`.}

\item{outdir}{A character string specifying the output directory where the processed files will be saved.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing region information for each formatted LD file, detailing the locations and specifics of the regions processed.
}
\description{
This function converts a lower triangle LD (Linkage Disequilibrium) matrix into a symmetrical full matrix suitable for cTWAS analysis. It then saves the result in both RDS and Rvar formats in the specified output directory. This is particularly useful for genetic analysis workflows that require full matrix formats for computational processes.
}
\details{
On execution, the function writes two types of files to the `outdir`:
\itemize{
  \item An `.RDS` file, which contains the fully processed symmetrical LD matrix.
  \item A `.Rvar` file, which includes variance estimates for the LD regions processed.
}
}
\examples{
convert_ld_matrix(ld_paths = c("/path/to/ld/chr1/chr1_12345_17755.cor.xz"),
                  outdir = "path/to/output")
}
