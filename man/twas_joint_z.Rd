\title{Multi-condition TWAS joint test}
\usage{
twas_joint_z(weights, z, R = NULL, X = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{weights}{A matrix of weights, where each column corresponds to a different condition.}

\item{z}{A vector of GWAS z-scores.}

\item{R}{An optional correlation matrix. If not provided, it will be calculated from the genotype matrix X.}

\item{X}{An optional genotype matrix. If R is not provided, X must be supplied to calculate the correlation matrix.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item Z: A matrix of TWAS z-scores and p-values for each condition.
  \item GBJ: The result of the GBJ test.
}
}
\description{
This function performs a multi-condition TWAS joint test using the GBJ method.
It assumes that the input genotype matrix (X) is standardized.
