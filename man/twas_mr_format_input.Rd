\usage{
twas_mr_format_input(cand_genes, susie_path, weights_file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{cand_genes}{A data frame of significant candidate genes after PTWAS step with columns "chr", "gene_id" and "gene_name"}

\item{susie_path}{A data frame of the susie results path with columns "ID" and "path", "ID" is the gene names of cand_genes, and "path" is their susie results path.}

\item{weights_file_path}{A data frame of the output files path of ptwas.R with the columns "ID" and "path".}
}
\value{
A dataframe  of the mr function input format with the columns "snp", "bhat_x",	"sbhat_x", "pip", "cs", "X_ID", "gene_id", "bhat_y" and "sbhat_y", 
"bhat_x" and "sbhat_x" are effect size and standard error of exposure, "bhat_y" and "sbhat_y" are effect size and standard error of outcome, "pip" is the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) and "cs" is the credible set index
of susie result. "X_ID" and "gene_id" are ensemble ID and gene name respectively.
