\usage{
adjust_susie_weights(weight_db_file, twas_weights, condition, keep_variants)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight_db_file}{A RDS file containing TWAS weights..}

\item{condition}{Optional; specific condition. If NULL, uses the first condition in xqtl_data.}

\item{keep_variants}{Vector of variant names to keep.}

\item{weights}{the output of `load_twas_weights function`, matrix of twas weights.}
}
\value{
Adjusted xQTL coefficients.
}
\description{
This function adjusts the SuSiE weights based on a set of intersected variants.
It subsets various components like lbf_matrix, mu, and scale factors based on these variants.
