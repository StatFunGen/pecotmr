\arguments{
\item{sumstat_path}{File path to the summary statistics.}

\item{column_file_path}{File path to the column file for mapping.}

\item{n_sample}{User-specified sample size. If unknown, set as 0 to retrieve from the sumstat file.}

\item{n_case}{User-specified number of cases.}

\item{n_control}{User-specified number of controls.}

\value{
A list of rss_input, including the column-name-formatted summary statistics,
sample size (n), and var_y.

\description{
This function formats the input summary statistics dataframe with uniform column names
to fit into the SuSiE pipeline. The mapping is performed through the specified column file.
Additionally, it extracts sample size, case number, control number, and variance of Y.
Missing values in n_sample, n_case, and n_control are backfilled with median values.
